Hey everyone, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, pain de mie. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Pain de Mie This delicious, fine-grained loaf is perfect for sandwiches and toast — including French toast and melba toast. This pain de mie is sublime when heavily toasted and topped with a good margin of butter. This style of bread is sometimes called a &#34;Pullman Loaf,&#34; or simply just &#34;sandwich bread,&#34; but they all have the same undeniable characteristics: a soft and minimal crust, a slightly sweet flavor, warmth and depth from just enough butter in the dough, and an ethereally light interior. Pain de mie is a fine-textured, moist bread baked in a special lidded pan.

Pain de mie is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals on earth. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. Pain de mie is something that I've loved my entire life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pain de mie:

1. Take 540 g farine

Compared to the usual types, Pain de Mie is sweeter. The crumbly texture that it owes its name to is due to the smaller air pockets found in its dough. Pain de mie means &#34;bread of the crumb&#34; in French, and it&#39;s called that because of how the bread is baked; the vessel that holds the dough creates a finished product with very little crust and almost all crumb. The butter and milk make this a soft and malleable dough, which is supported by the pan it&#39;s baked in.
