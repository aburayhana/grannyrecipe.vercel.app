Hello everybody, it's Jim, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a special dish, tzatziki. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Tzatziki is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It's enjoyed by millions daily. Tzatziki is something which I have loved my entire life. They are fine and they look fantastic.

Add lemon zest, dill, salt, and pepper; whisk until smooth. Watch how to make this recipe. Place the yogurt in a cheesecloth or paper towel-lined sieve and set it over a bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, cucumber, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice and dill.


To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have tzatziki using 4 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tzatziki:

1. Prepare 1 concombre bio
1. Get 1 yaourt brassé
1. Prepare  du jus de citron
1. Get  sel poivre


But the one non-negotiable item is the strained, full fat yogurt. Called Cacik in Turkey, Tarator in the Balkans, Tzatziki in Greece, each version of this salad is a variation on a theme: yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, fresh herbs. The yogurt is thick, and pungent. This wonderful meze (we do not think of it as a sauce here- it is a thick &#39;salata&#39;) is used to counterpoint rich, bbq&#39;d meats (like souvlaki/shish kebab), but can be used in more diverse ways.
