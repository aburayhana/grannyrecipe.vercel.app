Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to make a special dish, tzatziki. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Tzatziki is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. It is enjoyed by millions every day. Tzatziki is something that I've loved my whole life. They're fine and they look wonderful.

Add lemon zest, dill, salt, and pepper; whisk until smooth. Watch how to make this recipe. Place the yogurt in a cheesecloth or paper towel-lined sieve and set it over a bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, cucumber, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice and dill.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have tzatziki using 7 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tzatziki:

1. Make ready 1 concombre
1. Make ready 1 gousse d’ail
1. Take 1 petit bouquet de menthe
1. Take 1 petit bouquet de coriandre
1. Make ready 4 cuillère à soupe d’huile d’olive
1. Make ready 1 yaourt grec
1. Get  Poivre et sel


But the one non-negotiable item is the strained, full fat yogurt. Called Cacik in Turkey, Tarator in the Balkans, Tzatziki in Greece, each version of this salad is a variation on a theme: yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, fresh herbs. The yogurt is thick, and pungent. This wonderful meze (we do not think of it as a sauce here- it is a thick &#39;salata&#39;) is used to counterpoint rich, bbq&#39;d meats (like souvlaki/shish kebab), but can be used in more diverse ways.
