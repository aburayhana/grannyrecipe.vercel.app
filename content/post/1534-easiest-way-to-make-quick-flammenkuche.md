Flammekueche is known as a plat du pauvre — a dish of the poor — traditionally made on bread-baking day, while the villagers waited for the heat of the communal oven to abate.

Also known as tarte flambée, the flammekueche (pronounced flam-küsh *) can be described as the Alsatian pizza: a super thin round of dough topped with cream, finely sliced onions, bacon strips, and sometimes mushrooms (la forestière) and cheese (la gratinée), baked in a woodfire oven until the edges are golden brown and crisp.
