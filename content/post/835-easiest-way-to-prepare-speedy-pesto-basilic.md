The pesto that most of the world knows as the one-and-only &#34;pesto&#34; is, in fact, just one of endless kinds.&#34;Pesto&#34; means &#34;pounded,&#34; from the verb pestare (&#34;to pound&#34;), because the old-fashioned way to make pesto (and the one that many cooks still swear by) is to pound the ingredients -- a mixture of aromatic herbs, salt, garlic, olive oil, cheese, and sometimes nuts -- with a mortar and pestle. Purchased pesto is one of the best convenience foods on the market, and pesto from scratch is simple to prepare and even more delicious. Traditional pesto is made of fresh basil leaves, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and pine nuts, but there are plenty of other recipes including alternative herbs and nuts such as chives and walnuts. Although it is most commonly used to top cooked pasta.
