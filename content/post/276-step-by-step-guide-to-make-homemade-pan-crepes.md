Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, pan crêpes. One of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

The subsequent crepes will require much less time to cook than the first crepe, as the pan heats up even more with each crepe. This French delicacy is extremely versatile, as it can be filled with virtually anything -- fruits, pudding, mousse for desserts as well as vegetables and meats for dinner. No need to add more oil each time unless the pan begins to stick. This is a pan that is made in France where crepes are originally from.
