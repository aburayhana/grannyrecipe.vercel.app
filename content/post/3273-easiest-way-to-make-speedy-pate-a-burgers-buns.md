Hey everyone, it is Jim, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, pâte à burgers/buns. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Pâte à burgers/buns is one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions every day. Pâte à burgers/buns is something that I have loved my whole life. They're fine and they look wonderful.

The memories this &#34;burger bun&#34; style brings back. Often called home hamburger or in my childhood home, Dad burgers. This is the bun of choice for people too lazy to go to the store, or too cheap to buy burger buns. If you are desperate a couple of slices of bread does the job, just make sure you eat them as fast as possible because it will.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook pâte à burgers/buns using 8 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pâte à burgers/buns:

1. Take 200 ml lait tiède
1. Make ready 100 ml d’eau tiède
1. Make ready  Levure fraîche ou déshydratée
1. Take 50 ml d’huile neutre
1. Prepare 1 cs miel
1. Prepare 1 oeuf
1. Make ready  Farine à l’oeil
1. Make ready  Sel


A little melted butter or mayo adds flavor to the toasted buns. Watch the buns closely no matter which method you choose to avoid burning. When it comes to using a brioche burger bun, I recommend using them for gourmet burgers. Since brioche is a &#34;rich&#34; bread, use it with a &#34;rich&#34; burger. (My brie, green apple, and basil burger, for example.) The nice thing with this brioche recipe is that it doesn&#39;t melt under the weight of a juicy burger.
