Hey everyone, it's John, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, tzatziki. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Tzatziki is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods on earth. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions every day. Tzatziki is something which I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

Add lemon zest, dill, salt, and pepper; whisk until smooth. Watch how to make this recipe. Place the yogurt in a cheesecloth or paper towel-lined sieve and set it over a bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, cucumber, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice and dill.


To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have tzatziki using 6 ingredients and 2 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tzatziki:

1. Make ready 1/2 concombre
1. Make ready 300 g fromage blanc
1. Prepare 1 poignée de feuilles de menthe
1. Make ready 1/2 citron
1. Make ready 1 gousse d&#39;ail
1. Take  Sel et poivre


But the one non-negotiable item is the strained, full fat yogurt. Called Cacik in Turkey, Tarator in the Balkans, Tzatziki in Greece, each version of this salad is a variation on a theme: yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, fresh herbs. The yogurt is thick, and pungent. This wonderful meze (we do not think of it as a sauce here- it is a thick &#39;salata&#39;) is used to counterpoint rich, bbq&#39;d meats (like souvlaki/shish kebab), but can be used in more diverse ways.

Place a small plate full on your dinner table for people to scoop up small amounts onto their bread (preferably crisp-baked pita).
