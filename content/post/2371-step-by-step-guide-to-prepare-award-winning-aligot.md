![Aligot](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/9ae360f2da048e29/751x532cq70/aligot-photo-principale-de-la-recette.jpg)

Hey everyone, it is me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe site. Today, we're going to make a distinctive dish, aligot. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Aligot does not keep very well. However, if you must, it can be held for a short time by placing grease-proof paper like parchment on the surface of the potatoes, making sure it is in direct contact with the aligot. This method will help prevent a skin forming on the potatoes, which would make the aligot unpleasantly lumpy if you stir it in. Aligot is a dish made from cheese blended into mashed potatoes (often with some garlic) that is made in L&#39;Aubrac (Aveyron, Cantal, Lozère, Occitanie) region in the southern Massif Central of France.

Aligot is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It's enjoyed by millions daily. They're nice and they look wonderful. Aligot is something which I have loved my whole life.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can have aligot using 7 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Aligot:

1. Make ready 1 kg pommes de terre à purée
1. Make ready 500 g tomme fraîche
1. Make ready 10 cl lait
1. Make ready  Ail
1. Make ready  Beurre
1. Make ready  Sel
1. Prepare  Poivre


Potatoes can be used in so many ways: gnocchi, French fries, smashed potatoes, mashed potatoes, potato dauphinois, pomme purée, and, what I feel is the highest form of potatory, the aligot. When made well, it should be very smooth. I hate mealy aligot potatoes that happen when the potatoes aren&#39;t hot enough and are overworked at low temperature. Aligot is a comforting dish of cheesy whipped potatoes that originated in the L&#39;Aubrac region of central France.

Aligot is a comforting dish of cheesy whipped potatoes that originated in the L&#39;Aubrac region of central France. Traditional aligot is made with Tomme d&#39;Auvergne, a creamy young cheese that&#39;s. In a large pot over medium-high heat, add the potatoes, garlic, and cover with cold water. Add a big pinch of salt.
