One enduring origin story holds that french fries were invented by street vendors on the Pont Neuf bridge. The thinner these are, the crispier they will be.

Remove potatoes from oil with a slotted spoon to drain on paper towel and to cool completely. The oil needs to be just the right temperature -- too cool, the potatoes will absorb the oil; too hot, the outsides of the potatoes will burn.
