Hey everyone, hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, smoothie pina colada. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Smoothie pina colada is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions every day. It's easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They're nice and they look wonderful. Smoothie pina colada is something that I have loved my whole life.

I liked this smoothie but didn&#39;t think it really was too close to a pina colada flavor (admittedly that could have been a result of having to add more milk). Toasted a little coconut which was a nice garnish and added some needed coconut flavor to the smoothie. The sweet, breezy flavor of piña coladas instantly puts me in a good mood — likely because the combo of coconut and pineapple transports my mind to the tropics. This fruity smoothie, made with chunks of fresh or frozen pineapple, coconut milk, and creamy banana, is the perfect way to enjoy those tropical flavors without leaving your house.


To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have smoothie pina colada using 3 ingredients and 1 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Smoothie pina colada:

1. Take 1/2 litre jus d&#39;ananas
1. Get 2 doses de rhum
1. Make ready 2 boules de glace a la noix de coco


Combine coconut milk, banana, pineapple, mango and protein powder in a blender and blend on high until smooth. Garnish with a wedge of pineapple and serve. To make this healthy piña colada smoothie, we replace the pineapple juice that is used in a traditional piña colada with fresh pineapple chunks! And if I&#39;m being perfectly honest, I think the fresh pineapple brings out more flavor and even creates more natural texture to the smoothie than if we were to use pineapple juice.

I&#39;ve had a love affair with pineapple since I was seven years old. I know for a fact I was exactly seven because that is when my parents took a no-kids vacation to Hawaii and brought back a carry-on suitcase stuffed to the brim with fresh, straight from. To make the piña colada smoothie, simply combine the pineapple, banana, almond milk, coconut extract, and optional sweetener in a blender.
